# üõ°Ô∏è Phalanx SRE ‚Äì Palantir-Inspired Use Cases

This document details the **five showcase scenarios** that demonstrate how
Phalanx SRE fuses multi-hop packet forensics, topology mapping, and agentic AI into
a single operational intelligence platform ‚Äî and how it can be integrated more
easily than traditional, high-barrier solutions.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Domain Incident Causality

### **Scenario**
An application‚Äôs response time spikes during peak hours. Metrics in one dashboard show CPU usage climbing, logs in another show timeouts, and packet captures (in yet another tool) suggest retransmissions. The root cause is hidden across multiple data silos.

### **How Traditional SRE Toolkits Handle It**
- Requires multiple dashboards (APM, NMS, packet analyzers)
- Manual correlation across logs, traces, metrics, and PCAPs
- High Mean Time To Innocence (MTTI) for each team

### **How Phalanx Handles It**
- Unified ontology links service nodes, network paths, deploy metadata, and packet KPIs
- Multi-hop capture stitches packets into one TCP/UDP conversation
- AI diagnoses likely cause (e.g., congestion at hop 3 after deploy)
- Visual battlemap shows both service and network layers in one pane

### **Ease of Integration**
- API-first ingest: point existing packet capture or metrics exporters at Phalanx
- Can start with a single capture agent at one hop and expand incrementally
- Works with existing PCAPs ‚Äî no need to replace capture tools

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Trust-Weighted Automated Remediation

### **Scenario**
A routing change introduces asymmetric paths, degrading performance for a critical service. Automatic failover is possible, but risky without consensus.

### **How Traditional SRE Toolkits Handle It**
- Either trigger failover automatically (risking false positives) or require manual approval
- No cross-team voting or governance mechanism built-in

### **How Phalanx Handles It**
- Advisor unit proposes remediation plan
- Multi-agent voting (trust-weighted) approves or vetoes
- If approved, automation triggers failover in coordination with existing systems (BGP, SDN, etc.)
- Decision and outcome logged in case history

### **Ease of Integration**
- Trust policy stored in JSON; easy to align with existing ITIL or change-control workflows
- Hooks into current automation tools (Ansible, Terraform, NSO, etc.)
- Modular ‚Äî governance can be turned on/off per environment

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic SLO Prioritization

### **Scenario**
Multiple incidents occur at once ‚Äî one affects an internal tool, the other affects a customer-facing revenue service.

### **How Traditional SRE Toolkits Handle It**
- Alerts often handled in the order they arrive
- Business impact may be estimated manually

### **How Phalanx Handles It**
- Links service health to business impact metrics
- Ranks incidents dynamically based on revenue/customer effect
- Adjusts SLO burn rate estimates in real time
- Visual priority indicators on the battlemap

### **Ease of Integration**
- Business impact can be fed from existing BI/monitoring APIs
- No need to re-instrument apps ‚Äî Phalanx consumes existing metrics
- Rules for prioritization are transparent and editable

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Incident War Room

### **Scenario**
A major outage unfolds. Multiple teams join calls, share screens, and try to sync on what‚Äôs broken and why.

### **How Traditional SRE Toolkits Handle It**
- Screen-share chaos with multiple disjointed dashboards
- Context switching delays diagnosis

### **How Phalanx Handles It**
- One shared real-time battlemap view
- Ladder diagrams show the actual packet-level conversation across hops
- AI-generated incident narrative updates as new evidence arrives
- Everyone sees the same source of truth

### **Ease of Integration**
- No rip-and-replace ‚Äî can overlay on top of existing monitoring systems
- Web-based dashboard accessible via SSO
- Demo mode allows training without touching production

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Ops Planning

### **Scenario**
An upcoming event (e.g., marketing launch) will triple traffic to a critical service. Capacity planning is based on rough historical trends.

### **How Traditional SRE Toolkits Handle It**
- Capacity forecasts from spreadsheets or APM history
- Limited simulation capability

### **How Phalanx Handles It**
- Digital twin simulates increased load on topology and network paths
- Predicts SLO burn and capacity risks
- Recommends routing changes or scaling actions in advance
- Scenario results stored for post-event analysis

### **Ease of Integration**
- Can simulate using synthetic data ‚Äî no production impact
- Works with existing topology and metric exports
- Incremental deployment ‚Äî start simulation on one service before scaling up

## Integration Philosophy

Phalanx SRE is designed to **avoid the common pitfalls** of large-scale operational intelligence deployments:

- **API-First Design** ‚Äì Ingest from existing systems, export results anywhere
- **Modular Deployment** ‚Äì Start with one hop, grow as needed
- **Open Standards** ‚Äì PCAP, JSON, WebSocket, REST ‚Äî no proprietary lock-in
- **Demo Mode** - Try the full platform without touching production traffic
- **Optional AI Layers** ‚Äì Begin with deterministic rules, add ML/LLM later

This lowers both **cost** and **time-to-value**, making it feasible for smaller orgs while still being attractive to enterprise-scale SRE teams.

## Summary
These five scenarios are **Palantir-level operational intelligence** applied to the SRE world but built with integration speed, modularity, and openness as core design goals.

Phalanx SRE turns ‚Äúdata spread across five dashboards‚Äù into ‚Äúa single operational truth‚Äù that can explain, visualize, and act.
