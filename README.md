# 🛡️ Phalanx SRE – Coordinated Intelligence for the Modern SRE Battlefield

**Phalanx SRE** is an **AI-powered, multi-agent operational intelligence platform** inspired by the architectures of **Palantir Foundry** and **Gotham**.
It fuses **network telemetry**, **service topology**, and **multi-hop packet forensics** into a **unified operational graph** for Site Reliability Engineers operating in high-stakes environments.

Unlike traditional SRE toolkits, Phalanx doesn’t just show you problems — it:
- Explains them in **plain English**
- Visualizes them **in real time**
- Recommends **(or executes)** the optimal response
- Predicts issues **before** they impact SLAs

---

## Planned Capabilities

### **Foundry-Inspired**
- **Unified Ontology Layer** – Service, network, and business context modeled as one graph
- **Operational Pipelines** – Chainable transforms for metrics, traces, and captures
- **Digital Twin Simulation** – What-if scenarios for outages, capacity spikes, or routing changes
- **Governance Framework** – Role-based and trust-weighted decision approvals
- **Data Fusion** – Combine telemetry, packet forensics, incident history, and deploy metadata

### **Gotham-Inspired**
- **Entity Resolution** – Merge multi-hop packet captures into a single, coherent TCP/UDP conversation
- **Link & Graph Analysis** – Visualize operational relationships and dependencies
- **Live Investigative War Room** – Real-time graph and packet ladder during incidents
- **Case Journaling** – AI-generated incident narratives with supporting evidence
- **Access Controls & Redaction** – Fine-grained visibility for sensitive data

### **Core SRE Intelligence**
- **Multi-Hop Packet Capture & Stitching** – Distributed capture agents at every hop in the path
- **AI-Driven Diagnosis** – ML + rules + LLM explanations for root cause
- **Asymmetry & Path MTU Detection** – Identify routing changes, PMTUD blackholes, and MSS mismatches
- **Dynamic SLO Prioritization** – Rank incidents by *business* impact, not just technical severity
- **Trust-Weighted Remediation** – Multi-agent voting before applying risky changes
- **Predictive Ops Planning** – Forecast SLO burn and resource needs
- **Automation First** – If it’s manual twice, it’s automated once

## Why Phalanx SRE Surpasses Traditional Toolkits

| Capability | Traditional SRE Stack | **Phalanx SRE** Advantage |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Data Sources** | Fragmented (metrics, logs, traces, packets all in different tools) | Unified ontology linking metrics, packets, deploys, incidents, and topology |
| **Incident Diagnosis** | Manual triage via multiple dashboards | AI-driven cause analysis with multi-hop packet evidence |
| **Cross-Domain Correlation** | Ad hoc scripting | Native entity graph + operational pipelines |
| **Governance** | None or tool-specific | Trust-weighted, role-aware decision engine |
| **Visualization** | Isolated charts | Real-time operational graph + ladder diagrams |
| **Remediation** | Manual or brittle scripts | Agentic automation with guardrails and approvals |
| **Predictive Modeling** | Limited to capacity planning | Full digital twin simulation of services and network paths |

## Call to Action
Phalanx SRE is a proof-of-concept to **show what’s possible** when operational telemetry, packet forensics, and agentic AI are unified in one platform.
It’s a love letter to **data fusion, coordinated response, and predictive ops** and a challenge to rethink how SRE should work.
